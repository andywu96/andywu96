👋 Hi, my name is Andy, come from Taiwan, with 2 years working experience as a data analyst

👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and Data Science opportunities in the United States

🌱 I’m currently a Master Student major in Analytics at University of Southern California

💞️ I’m a highly responsible person who is also cooperative, meticulous, and innovative. Always eager to learn new things with considerable passion and curiosity. Based on my study and experiences in Data Analytics, I look forward to exploring more and applying what I have learned to business.
